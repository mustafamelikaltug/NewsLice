# NewsLice
A Kotlin-based application using the MVVM architecture pattern allows users to read news. Although users can get the most recent news by swiping, a feature that arranges API calls every 60 minutes and saves news data that is being fetched to local storage was added to reduce the amount of internet usage by the application.
